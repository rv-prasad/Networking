Under this Lab work. we have created an organziation setup with 2 Hub and 3 Spoke.
WAN link resides in the INET vrf Eth0/0 (1.1.1.0/24)
We have created DMVPN Tunnel10 <192.168.1.0/24> with Hub-1 and Tunnel20 with Hub-2 
There is BGP peering over Tunnel interfaces.
We have IPKAMP configured using IKEv1 with Policy and IPsec to use this Policy.
Tunnel is protected using IPsec Policy created.
